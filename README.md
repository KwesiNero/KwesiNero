### 🔍 Current Mission
I'm rebuilding the financial & administrative data infrastructure of St. Thomas Residential School 
(600+ learners) where I've worked for 7 years. Moving from fragile Excel/VBA to robust Python/SQL pipelines.

**What I'm solving:**
- 💸 **Fee Default Prediction**: Reducing 15% annual arrears through ML
- ⚡ **Load-shedding Resilience**: Cloud-backed systems that survive SA power cuts  
- 🛡️ **POPIA Compliance**: Proper data governance for South African schools
- 🔄 **Reconciliation Automation**: 3 days → 30 minutes
